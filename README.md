# Delphi sample projects

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

Set of projects demonstrating the features of the Delphi development environment, its libraries and its programming language.

Some of the projects have been presented at conferences, on training courses or online coding sessions.

The programs are up to date with the [Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter) and the commercial version of [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) or [RAD Studio](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio).

You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).

A lot of code repositories show other Delphi project samples. Some of them are listed on [this page](OtherDelphiSampleRepositories.md). Be free to update it [with a PULL REQUEST](CONTRIBUTING.md) or by [filling an issue](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-samples/issues).

## Source code installation

To download this code repository, we recommend using "git", but you can also download a ZIP file directly from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-samples).

This project uses dependencies in the form of sub-modules. They will be absent from the ZIP file. You'll have to download them by hand.

* [DeveloppeurPascal/librairies](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/librairies) must be installed in the ./Libraries/librairies subfolder.
* [DeveloppeurPascal/Socket-Messaging-Library](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Socket-Messaging-Library) must be installed in the ./Libraries/Socket-Messaging-Library subfolder.

Some projects needs sample databases installed as option with Delphi samples. If you don't have them, you'll find them in menu "Tools / Manage plateforms" then tab item "other options" and "samples" to install.

The sample FireDAC-Samples\003-CDataRSS uses the [FireDAC RSS driver](https://cdata.com/drivers/rss/firedac/) from [CData](https://cdata.com/).
(if you use the evaluation release, compile in 64 bits, the 32 bits DLL is not available)

The sample FireDAC-Samples\004-MultiDBSample uses the [FireDAC RSS driver](https://cdata.com/drivers/rss/firedac/) from [CData](https://cdata.com/).
(if you use the evaluation release, compile in 64 bits, the 32 bits DLL is not available)

The sample IoT-Samples\002-BeaconFence uses "[Beacon Fence](https://getitnow.embarcadero.com/beaconfence/)" components from GetIt.

The sample IoT-Samples\004-Arduino-Mastermind uses "[AsyncPro for VCL](https://getitnow.embarcadero.com/AsyncPro-Sydney/)" components from GetIt and [Visuino IDE](https://www.visuino.com/) for the Arduino program.

The sample IoT-Samples\005-Joystick uses "[Radiant Shape](https://getitnow.embarcadero.com/bonus-radiant-shapes/)" components from GetIt, "[CommunicationLab](https://mitov.com/products/communicationlab)" library from [Boian Mitov](https://mitov.com/) and [Visuino IDE](https://www.visuino.com/) for the Arduino program.

The sample Web-Samples\011-UniGUI uses [UniGUI](http://www.unigui.com/).

The sample Web-Samples\012-UniGUI-Database uses [UniGUI](http://www.unigui.com/).

The sample Web-Samples\013-TMSWebCore-HelloWorld uses [TMS Web Core](https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/tmswebcoreintro.asp).

The sample Web-Samples\014-TMSWebCore-DisplayJSON uses [TMS Web Core](https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/tmswebcoreintro.asp).
