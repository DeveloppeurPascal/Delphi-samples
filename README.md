# Delphi sample projects

[Cette page en français.](LISEZMOI.md)

Set of projects demonstrating the features of the Delphi development environment, its libraries and its programming language.

Some of the projects have been presented at conferences, on training courses or online coding sessions.

The programs are up to date with the [Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter) and the commercial version of [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) or [RAD Studio](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio).

The sample FireDAC-Samples\003-CDataRSS uses the [FireDAC RSS driver](https://cdata.com/drivers/rss/firedac/) from [CData](https://cdata.com/).
(if you use the evaluation release, compile in 64 bits, the 32 bits DLL is not available)

The sample FireDAC-Samples\004-MultiDBSample uses the [FireDAC RSS driver](https://cdata.com/drivers/rss/firedac/) from [CData](https://cdata.com/).
(if you use the evaluation release, compile in 64 bits, the 32 bits DLL is not available)

The sample IoT-Samples\002-BeaconFence uses "[Beacon Fence](https://getitnow.embarcadero.com/beaconfence/)" components from GetIt.

The sample IoT-Samples\004-Arduino-Mastermind uses "[AsyncPro for VCL](https://getitnow.embarcadero.com/AsyncPro-Sydney/)" components from GetIt and [Visuino IDE](https://www.visuino.com/) for the Arduino program.

The sample IoT-Samples\005-Joystick uses "[Radiant Shape](https://getitnow.embarcadero.com/bonus-radiant-shapes/)" components from GetIt, "[CommunicationLab](https://mitov.com/products/communicationlab)" library from [Boian Mitov](https://mitov.com/) and [Visuino IDE](https://www.visuino.com/) for the Arduino program.

The sample Web-Samples\011-UniGUI uses [UniGUI](http://www.unigui.com/).

The sample Web-Samples\012-UniGUI-Database uses [UniGUI](http://www.unigui.com/).

The sample Web-Samples\013-TMSWebCore-HelloWorld uses [TMS Web Core](https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/tmswebcoreintro.asp).

The sample Web-Samples\014-TMSWebCore-DisplayJSON uses [TMS Web Core](https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/tmswebcoreintro.asp).

## How to ask a new feature, report a bug or a security issue ?
