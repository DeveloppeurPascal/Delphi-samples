# FMX Dialog Box Sample

This project shows how to display a confirmation dialog box in a FireMonkey project for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS. It uses the asynchronous mode to have the same behaviour on each platforms and allows Windows debugging before testing on other devices.

If you want to do the same in a VCL project for Windows only, look at [this sample](../../VCL-Samples/010-DialogBox/).
