# File and folder display and selection

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

Display of a browsable tree of files and folders with folder selection.

These two examples were developed during [a live coding session on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin). If you want to understand how to do the same at home rather than copying existing code, [the replay (in french)](https://serialstreameur.fr/faire-une-liste-de-selection-de-fichiers-et-dossiers-avec-firemonkey.html) is available on [Serial Streamer](https://serialstreameur.fr/). More explanations are available on [the blog](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/faire-une-liste-de-selection-de-fichiers-et-dossiers-pour-un-projet-firemonkey.html). An auto captioned replay is [available on YouTube](https://youtu.be/vcA52gRbHec) if you need some text to understand the process.

## FolderOrFileSelect project

This project shows the basic version for testing and running the list.

## FolderOrFileSelectWithFrame

This project uses the other one by transforming the result into a FMX frame that can be reused in other projects. You can use it by changing the images linked to the list items.

## License

The folders and files images are licensed by [Adobe Stock](https://vasur.fr/adobestock). Don't use them outside this sample project.

The image list has been generated by [Folder2FMXImageList](https://folder2fmximagelist.olfsoftware.fr/).
