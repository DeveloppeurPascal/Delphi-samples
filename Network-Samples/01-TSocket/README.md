# TSocket sample

Simple sample of use of the TSocket component from System.Net.Socket Delphi unit.

It was used during the "[Client server made easy with the Socket Messaging library for Delphi](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/DCB2023-Socket-Messaging-library-and-generator)" session of the [Coding Bootcamp 2023](https://learndelphi.org/coding-bootcamp-2023/) to explain how the network sockets work.

A replay of [the full presentation](https://serialstreameur.fr/client-server-made-easy-with-the-socket-messaging-library-for-delphi-coding-bootcamp-2023.html) can be seen on [Serial Streamer](https://serialstreameur.fr/).

During the presentation, you were shown an accelerated and slightly cut version of this code review. The full version in French is [available on Developpeur Pascal](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/exemple-d-utilisation-du-composant-tsocket-dans-un-projet-delphi.html).
